# Promises

## This module is to test a basic understanding and usage of JavaScript promises. Try to pass all tests. It might be easier to go in numeric order for the tests

#### When Starting:

Make sure you are in the directory named "challenge_2". Run `npm i` on the command line.

Fill in the blank test templates in the file "applicantAnswers.js" with your answers. There are five tests in order of increasing difficulty. Each test uses one or more utility function from the file "utils.js". Read the instruction in the comment above a particular answer for the instructions. Whenever you want to check if your answer is correct, run `npm test`.

If you want to console log something for troubleshooting, run `node applicantAnswers.js`.
