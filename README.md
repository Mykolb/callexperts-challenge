# Applicant Coding Challenges

## This repo contains 2 coding challenges for applicants of the entry-level developer role at Call Experts.

1. The first challenge (outlined in challenge_1.txt) is designed to test your ability to use React to recreate a well-designed web page. You are asked to recreate the airbnb website landing page with React and Material UI.

   Deployed challenge 1: https://mykolb.github.io/callexperts-coding-challenge/

2. The second challenge (challenge_2 folder) is designed to test your understanding of JS promises. The folder contains exercises to complete and unit tests that you can run to verify your answers are correct.

If you get stuck on anything, keep in mind that not getting everything perfect does not automatically disqualify you for consideration, we want to see what you can do and check out your coding practices.
