Recreate their airbnb landing page (https://www.airbnb.com) using React and Material UI.

-Do not worry about tweaking it to make it "perfect", just try to make it look good and fairly close to the landing page.
-Do not implement search functionality, navigating pages, etc, just worry about the look and feel of the page
-Have it resize for mobile.
-Inspect the source code to get images.

The primary goal of this exercise is to show that you can create a UI given a set of requirements.
The exact method you used to reach the end goal will be scrutinized less than the end product itself.
